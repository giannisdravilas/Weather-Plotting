# Weather-Plotting

🌀❄️🌩️ This repository contains some examples for creating 2d and 3d weather plots using matplotlib and cartopy libraries in python3.
<br>
Every directory also contains samples depicting the result of the provided code.

__geopHeight3d__

Creates a 3d plot of the Geopotential Height on the level of 500 hPa on a given date, according to ICON-EU forecasting model's real-time data provided by the DWD. The z axis has a reduced scale and limits for a better representation of the 3d surface. A basemap using cartopy, is also used, combined with a simple contour plot on level 0, producing a projection of the data on a simple x,y layer.

__hurricaneTrack__

Creates a 2d plot of the hurricane Ida's track, which hit USA on 2021, according to NOAA's GFS forecast. The track is plotted on a 6-hour step, using a cyclone thumbnail on a geophysical basemap provided by NOAA. The maximum wind speed around the hurricane's track is also plotted, using a contour plot.

__precipitationGreece__

Creates a 2d plot of the accumulated precipitation in Greece on a given date, according to ICON-EU forecasting model's real-time data provided by the DWD and using a NWS' colormap.
